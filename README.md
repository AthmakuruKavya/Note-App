📝 Note-Taking App  

This is a simple note-taking web app built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. 

It allows users to **add, edit, and delete notes**, with data stored in **LocalStorage**, so notes remain even after refreshing the page.

The app features a clean, user-friendly interface and is designed to be lightweight and responsive. 🚀
